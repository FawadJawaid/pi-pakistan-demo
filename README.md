# Pi-Pakistan-Demo
It was an android application developed for the company Pi Pakistan. It fetches the data from the different sources to show it in the application. 
Retrofit has been used for parsing and fetching the data. For displaying the images in the ListView, I am using Picasso. This project can be helpful if you have a task to parse difficult JSON. 

Here is the YouTube video URL who explains this project:
